## Index
Step limit: How many frames each generation runs for.
Population size: The amount of rockets in each generation.
Mutation rate: Chance per rocket to have it's gene randomly muated.

## Compiling
You Need:
- SFML 2.5+
- C++17 compliant compiler
- CMake build system

run CMake on the project directory with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release and you'll get Makefile or equivalent for your platform, with which you can compile the game.
